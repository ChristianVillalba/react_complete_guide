## Description

This project is an expense tracker created using React.

We can see our expenses, showing the concept, the date and the amount.        
The expenes can be filtered by year.        
There is a chart, divided by months that shows in a visual our expenses.        
We can also add a new expenses using a Form        
When a new expense is added, it shows up and the chart updates.
